# Push working state to a PR
Our goal is to take the current state of our git diff (ALL The files), commit the files (with a reasonable commit message), push them (to a branch), open a PR,and surface the link to the PR back to me so I can click it.

## Workflow Details
For detailed git workflow information including branch naming conventions and recovery procedures, see [docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md](../../docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md).

## Quick Reference

### If on wrong branch
  - **On main**: `git reset --soft` to origin/main, stash, create feature branch, pop stash
  - **On unrelated branch**: Same process - reset to origin, stash, checkout main, pull, create new branch

### Pre-PR checklist
  1. Run `bundle exec standardrb --fix-unsafely` and commit any fixes
  2. Run tests with `bin/test test/*/*.rb` if changes might impact them
  
### Post-PR
  - **Regular repo**: Checkout main and pull latest (while showing PR URL)
  - **Git worktree**: Leave as-is (user will delete when PR is merged)
